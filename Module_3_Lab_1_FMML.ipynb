        "So, in a way, similarity is about closeness in characteristics, and distance is about literal space between them. They're two sides of the coin because you can often use one to calculate the other. If things are very similar, their distance is likely small, and vice versa. It's like a dance between how much things resemble each other and how much physical space separates them."
